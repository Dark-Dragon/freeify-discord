# Freeify Discord
## Purpose
This adblock filterlist aims to remove paid elements, payment options and pay reminders (shop, nitro, super, etc) from the in-browser discord client.

## Usage
To use, import this URL to your filterlists on uBlock Origin:

```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dark-Dragon/freeify-discord/main/freeify-discord```

If an element you think should be hidden is still visible, collapse it if possible and see if it disappears. If it isn't collapsible or remains visible after, I either wasn't able to filter the element without causing bugs (see issue #1 for instance) or I simply don't know about its existence (please open an issue with a screenshot of the element and instructions on where it can be found). Some very unintrusive elements are not hidden by choice (some settings options for instance).

## About
This project was created because using discord became increasingly annoying as more and more paid features got more and more intrusive advertising within the software. After tinkering with uBlock Origin, eventually I figured out how to block some of those annoyances. As I accumulated more filters, I felt like there might be at least a few other people on this planet who also use discord in their web-browser and don't want to be bothered by constant reminders to pay for a subscription. While I respect their service and understand that this is their business model, I simply want a cleaner and more functional experience than what they currently provide out of the box.

Feel free to contribute or let me know what's on your mind through this github project.

Note: I'm not very good at this, so use at your own risk.
